## Features of this collection

* Ansible-style arguments with extensive validation

  systemd's argument naming format is not compatible with Ansible best practices, so these roles
  use Ansible-style names and translate them when producing configuration files for systemd-networkd.
  For example, 'MACAddress' (systemd) becomes 'mac_address' (Ansible), 'IPv6ProxyNDPAddress' (systemd)
  becomes 'ipv6_proxy_ndp_address' (Ansible), etc.

  In addition Ansible's role `argument_specs` feature is used to fully document and validate all
  arguments passed to the roles, ensuring that configuration errors are discovered before the roles
  generate configuration files. The documentation linked in the 'Included content' section above is generated
  from the `argument_specs`.

* Composition (one role per systemd-networkd object, usually)

  Rather than providing a higher-level abstraction of a 'network' with all of its possible configuration
  options, these roles provide direct access to the systemd-networkd objects so that the user can configure
  and compose them in any way that they wish. See the 'Examples' section below for a complex real-world
  configuration.

* Use of drop-in directories

  In order to avoid multiple roles attempting to manage content in the same files, all of the roles make
  use of the systemd-networkd 'drop-in directory' feature where it is applicable.

## Using this collection

In order to use this collection, you need to install it using the
`ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install kpfleming.systemd_networkd

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it
via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the
format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: kpfleming.systemd_networkd
```
See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Examples

This playbook example combines six of the roles in this collection. It features:

* Renaming of two NICs (matched using their PCI paths) and bonding them using
  802.3ad (LACP).
* Two VLANs on top of of the bonded interface.
* A SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) tunnel on top of one of the VLANs.
* Three dummy interfaces used for application addresses.
* Various attributes and features of the 'network' role.
